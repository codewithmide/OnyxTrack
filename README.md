## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a supply chain management system using blockchain technology. The frontend provides a user interface to interact with the smart contract deployed on the Sepolia blockchain. Users can connect their wallets (Metamask or WalletConnect), view product details, track their movements, and more.

The smart contract facilitates the tracking of products, their states, and histories on the blockchain. It has been developed using Solidity and is deployed on Sepolia blockchain.

## Features

- Wallet connection with Metamask and WalletConnect using RainbowKit.
- Interact with the supply chain smart contract to add products, track their movements, and view histories.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI built with Next.js and Tailwindcss.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- Next.js: React framework for building the frontend.
- TypeScript: Provides type checking for JavaScript.
- RainbowKit: Library for handling wallet connections.
- Tailwind: CSS library used for designing the UI.

### Smart Contract

- Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
- Hardhat: Development environment for Ethereum with testing, debugging, and deployment tools.
- Ethers.js: Library for interacting with Ethereum and smart contracts.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewithmide/onyxtrack
   cd onyxtrack
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Interact with the frontend on localhost:3000

5. Follow the instructions in the `contract` directory's README to deploy and interact with the smart contract.
